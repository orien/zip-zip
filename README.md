# zip-zip

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zip-zip.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/zip-zip)

So you've upgraded a gem dependency that requires RubyZip v1.0.0 or higher.
While all your other dependencies use the interface provided by v0.x.

**zip-zip** provides a simple adapter to let all your dependencies use RubyZip v1.0.0.
It is very simple and light weight, aliasing the old class names to the new.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zip-zip'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zip-zip
